The most prominent opacity again is at the right lung base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are grossly stable. Again there is enlarged central pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Stable postsurgical changes of CABG and sternotomy. No pneumothorax. Similar findings of DISH in the spine with multilevel mild degenerative change. No acute bone findings. Impression: Grossly stable small pleural effusions with perhaps slight decrease in right effusion. Slight decrease in bibasilar opacities. The right consolidated lung is much greater than left.
