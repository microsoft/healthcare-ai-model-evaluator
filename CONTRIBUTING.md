### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Getting in touch

If your issue appears to be a bug, we appreciate if you report to us via latest contact channel in [Support](./SUPPORT.md).

Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

* Search the repository (https://github.com/microsoft/healthcare-ai-model-evaluator/pulls) for an open or closed PR
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

* Make your changes in a new git fork:

* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* Push your fork to GitHub:
* In GitHub, create a pull request
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Rebase your fork and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
